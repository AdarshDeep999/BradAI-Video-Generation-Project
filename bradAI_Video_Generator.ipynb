        "\n",
        "    Your output must be a single, valid JSON list. Each object in the list must have two keys: `audio_text` and `image_prompt`.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Here are the strict rules you must follow for every scene:\n",
        "\n",
        "    #### **I. General Visual and Character Consistency**\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.  **Core Aesthetic**: Every `image_prompt` must start with the core aesthetic: **\"{style}.\"**\n",
        "    2.  **Character Registry**: When a character is first introduced, create a detailed description for them based on the text. If the text provides no details, invent a plausible appearance. You must re-use this EXACT full description every time the character appears.\n",
        "    3.  **Background Registry**: Follow the same rule for settings. Describe them in detail once and re-use that full description.\n",
        "    4.  **Re-Use Full Descriptions**: For every prompt, every character and setting present MUST be described using their full registry details.\n",
        "\n",
        "    #### **II. Story Breakdown and Scene Management**\n",
        "\n",
        "    1.  **Split Complex Actions**: If a sentence has multiple distinct actions, break it into separate scenes.\n",
        "    2.  **Combine Filler Sentences**: If a sentence is an emotional detail or a non-visual thought, combine its text with the previous visual scene's `audio_text`.\n",
        "    3.  **Prioritize Focus and Action**: Place the main character and their primary action at the beginning of the `image_prompt`. For example: \"Leo cautiously approaching Cora...\". **Crucially, the action described in the `image_prompt` must ONLY be what is described in that same scene's `audio_text`. Do not include actions or reactions from future sentences.**\n",
        "    4.  **Detail Background Characters**: Always include full descriptions for characters in the background.\n",
        "    5.  **Quality Enhancers**: Always append the following to the very end of every `image_prompt`: \", highly detailed, cinematic lighting, masterpiece, sharp focus, intricate details.\"\n",
        "    6.  **Dynamic Negative Prompt**: You must generate a `negative_prompt` for every scene. The default should be \"blurry, lowres, bad anatomy, worst quality\". **Crucially, if the scene contains only ONE person, you MUST add \"duplicate, cloned, multiple people\" to the negative_prompt.** If the scene explicitly describes more than one person, you must NOT add these words.\n",
        "    7.  **Sentence Mapping Requirement**: Include a `sentence_ids` field listing the original sentence IDs used for the `audio_text`.\n",
